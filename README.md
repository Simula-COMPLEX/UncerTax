# UncerTax: Uncertainty Taxonomy

This repository contains an uncertainty taxonomy for self-adaptive robotics, derived from research published in *IEEE Software*.  

---

## 📂 Accessing the Taxonomy
You can explore the taxonomy in two primary formats:

* **[Interactive Web Page](https://simula-complex.github.io/uncertax/):** A web-based interface for dynamic exploration of taxonomy elements and their relationships.
* **[PDF Version](./taxonomypdf/UncerTax_Uncertainty Taxonomy.pdf):** A tabular version of the taxonomy for offline reference and documentation.
